## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Named fallback for every external kind

The system MUST map each external dependency kind to a named fallback. Supported kinds MUST include at least: geocoder/gazetteer, catalog acquire, retrieve, LLM, routing, GPS, IP, background worker, observability, and generate timeout. A failure in one kind MUST NOT cascade into invented coordinates, invented venues, or fake polylines.

#### Scenario: Geocoder empty or ambiguous

- **WHEN** geocoding times out, returns empty, or returns multiple plausible matches
- **THEN** the system continues via dialogue HITL or an honest ask and does not silently centroid-plan a country

#### Scenario: Retrieve empty

- **WHEN** place retrieve returns no catalog matches inside the resolved scope
- **THEN** the system uses an in-scope geo fallback if available, otherwise reports honest emptiness and HITL, and does not schedule invented venues

#### Scenario: Routing geometry missing

- **WHEN** routing cannot supply road geometry for a leg
- **THEN** the map shows stop points (and may use fail-soft travel times) and does not fabricate a polyline

#### Scenario: Generate wall-clock timeout

- **WHEN** a generate run exceeds its wall-clock timeout
- **THEN** remaining generate work stops, no successful trip is persisted from that run, and the outcome is recorded as timeout or aborted — not as a successful plan
